# Travel-Database

This project aims at designing a database system for a travel agency. This project will be using the
relational database system, MySQL as the database server to store and manage the operations of online
transactions. Java, JavaScript and JDBC will be used for connecting the user interface and the database
server.
In this project, we will design a database system for a travel agency. This agency will help the user
(customers) plan and book their trips (or vacations). The agency should support different modes of
transports, which may include flights, bus, car/taxi, and cruise. The user should be able to use the facilities
offered by this travel agency to not only plan her travel but also book the accommodation. You may look
at some commercial enterprises offering such services, example KAYAK.com. Please explore the
operations and the facilities available on these systems to get a better understanding of the system.
